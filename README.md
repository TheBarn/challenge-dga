This is the backend of our solution for the 42 / HEC hackathon challenge for the french army.

Team members: @pdespres @aprevel @fxbabin @TheBarn

The goal of the hackathon was to offer a tool to the learning officers which will help them during a war simulation. 
The war simulation lasts two days and officiers should take direct measures which will impact the outcome of the war.
Their orders are base on information which they receive every minute on a server, which could be war maps, news, reports...
These documents can be relevant or not, the crucial information could be on a single page of a 200 pages document, or on an image.

Our solution consisted of a web application which uses AI to search over the various format of the documents.
Officiers could ask a question or search an information through our application which would select the top five most relevant documents and open them on the right page.

Our team got first in this challenge!
